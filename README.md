Machine Learning Projects built using Google Colab
Breast Cancer Classification Project. 
Model is trained using Logistic Regression Algorithm.

There are two types of Breast Cancer: 
1. Benign
2. Malignant

**Attribute Information:**

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant -> 0, B = benign -> 1)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

**Libraries used:**
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Scikit Learn
